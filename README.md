# Object-Oriented-Programming-
Mini Library System 

## Project Overview
This Mini Library Management System is a python-based console program that demonstrate the use of core data structures dictionaries lists tuples to manage library operation efficiently.

The system allows users to perform essential library function such as:
-Adding new books and members
-Searching and updating records
-Borrowing and returning books
-Deleting entries safely

This project follows the CRUD model
(Creat,read,update,delete) and includes unit tests to validate the core functionalities.

## ðŸ§± Data Structures Used

| Data Structure | Purpose | Example |
|----------------|----------|----------|
| Dictionary | Store book details with ISBN as key | { "978-001": {"title": "Python Basics", "author": "John Doe", "genre": "Fiction", "copies": 3} } |
| List | Maintain list of library members | [{"member_id": "M001", "name": "Alice", "email": "alice@gmail.com"}] |
| Tuple | Store fixed list of genres | ("Fiction", "Non-Fiction", "Sci-Fi", "Romance") |
